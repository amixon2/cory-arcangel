    <p1><b>Name:</b> Let's Play Majerus G3 ðŸ–¼</p1>

    <br>
    <p4><b>Description:</b>  Cory Arcangel worked with Rhizome.org and the Michel Majerus Estate for over 7 years to restore Michel Majerus' laptop (his virtual studio). â€‹â€‹The Michel Majerus Estate is excited to introduce Letâ€™s Play Majerus G3, a project unveiling a previously undiscovered facet of the artistâ€™s archive: his computer. Driven by artist Cory Arcangel, this initiative revolves around Majerus's late-career laptop, which has been revived through a collaborative restoration effort with digital-art organization Rhizome.</p4>
    <br>
    <p5><b>Exhibition:</b> Michel Majerus Estate in Berlin</p5>
    <br>
    <p6><b>Cultural Impact:</b> Since the piece's exhibition hasnâ€™t happened yet, it would be hard to explain its cultural impact but I would assume it expresses the history of digital media culture.</p6>
